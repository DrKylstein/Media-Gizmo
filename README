This is a project which uses a character display and an IR reciever on an 
Arduino to interface with a media player and other functions on a Linux PC.

The core files for the Arduino are:
-ir_recieve.pde is the Arduino sketch.
-ir_recieve.py provides the interface to the Arduino (via PySerial)

Executable PC side files are:
-banshee_client.py uses Banshee as the Media Player (through 
mediaplayer_banshee.py), and D-Bus and xdotool for additional Linux Desktop 
functions.
-mpd_client.py uses python-mpd to serve as a client for the Media Player Daemon 
on a local server.
-Constants are located near the top of each file for setting the serial port to
use and other options.
